High Priority Improvements
1. Enhance Syntax Highlighting Coverage
The current grammar is basic. Based on LinuxCNC documentation, you should add:

HAL component types: Recognize built-in components like pid, encoder, stepgen, mux2, scale, etc.
Signal types: Highlight bit, float, s32, u32 data types
Pin directions: Recognize IN, OUT, IO keywords
Thread names: Highlight servo-thread, base-thread, etc.
HAL parameters: Distinguish between pins, parameters, and signals

2. Add IntelliSense/Autocomplete
The changelog mentions a Language Server for autocompletion is planned. This would be huge:

Autocomplete for HAL commands (loadrt, addf, setp, etc.)
Suggest available components from LinuxCNC library
Pin/signal name completion based on loaded components
Parameter suggestions for components

3. Improve INI File Support
The INI syntax is generic. Make it LinuxCNC-specific:

Recognize LinuxCNC-specific sections ([EMC], [DISPLAY], [TRAJ], [AXIS_X], etc.)
Highlight known configuration parameters
Validate section names and parameter names

4. Add Diagnostics/Linting

Detect undefined signals being used
Check for mismatched pin/signal types (bit vs float)
Warn about unused signals
Validate addf function calls (ensure component exists)
Check for proper loadrt before addf usage

5. Documentation/README Improvements
Current README is minimal. Add:

Screenshots showing different features
Installation instructions from marketplace
Feature list with examples
Link to LinuxCNC documentation
Contribution guidelines

6. Add Hover Documentation
Show documentation when hovering over:

HAL commands (what they do)
Component names (what pins they provide)
Common parameters (valid ranges, units)

7. Code Snippets
Add useful snippets for:

Common component configurations
Standard axis setup templates
PID tuning blocks
Spindle control patterns

8. Better Comment Handling
Support for:

TODO/FIXME highlighting in comments
Documentation comment blocks
Section header comments

9. Symbol Navigation
Implement:

Outline view showing all signals and components
Go to definition for signal names
Find all references for signals/pins

10. Validation Features

Check that net statements connect compatible pin types
Verify thread assignments are valid
Detect duplicate signal definitions
Check for signals that are set but never read (and vice versa)

Medium Priority
11. G-code Support
Add .ngc file support since LinuxCNC uses G-code
12. Configuration File Linking

Jump to definition when clicking [SECTION]PARAMETER references in HAL files
Navigate between related HAL and INI files

13. Better Icon
The current icon could be more distinctive/professional
14. Theme Integration
Test and optimize syntax colors for popular themes (Dark+, Light+, Monokai, etc.)
Low Priority
15. Testing
Add unit tests for the grammar and language features
16. Marketplace Optimization

Better description with keywords
More screenshots
Video demonstration
Better categorization

17. Formatter
Implement code formatting for consistent style
